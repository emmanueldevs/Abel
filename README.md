## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing and teaching purposes.

## Prerequisites or System Requirements

The requirements are pretty basic so just let me write them down here.

* PHP v5 or higher Server
* MySql database
* Mod_Rewrite enabled
* CSS3 supported web browser
* Register_globals enabled

## Installing

The installation is actually very easy and it circles around only 2 files. I am writing down the steps to install and customize.

Unzip the archive to your server

* Open "includes/db.php" and fill the database settings (read more in configuration option)
* Open "includes/config.php" and fill the optional site settings (read more in configuration option)
* Finally import the MySql database from the folder "SQL" in phpMyadmin
* Go to admin panel from yourdomain.com/admin (e.g "http//localhost/abel/admin") and use accordingly by logging inside with Username: "admin" and Password: "admin1234". You can later change the password from admin panel
* Script is all ready now. Feel free to customize the design but DON'T temper the code (if you need it to work but don't know what you are doing).

## Configuration

Here i will tell you how to configure the necessary installation files **db.php** and **config.php**

### db.php:

* $db_host - Enter the server address of the mysql server in this field. It is usually localhost in most of the cases
